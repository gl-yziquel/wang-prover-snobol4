Licensing:
==========

The author of this repository is currently unaware of the licensing of Wang's
theorem prover code.

It may however be found on the net with quite a bit of searching, and is of
historical significance. It is therefore made here available, under the
understanding that, should the copyright holder oppose its publication here, it
will be removed. This is a best effort policy, given the historical significance
of this piece of code.
